# Computer Vision Metrics Exploration

This repository covers exploring various computer vision metrics for fundamental tasks like image classification, object detection, and image segmentation. The aim is to understand, evaluate, and compare different metrics commonly used in these domains.

## Tasks Covered

### Image Classification
In image classification, we evaluate models based on several metrics:
- **Accuracy:** Percentage of correctly classified images.
- **Precision and Recall:** Measures for true positives, false positives, and false negatives.
- **F1 Score:** Harmonic mean of precision and recall.
- **Confusion Matrix:** Visual representation of model performance.

### Object Detection
For object detection tasks, metrics include:
- **Intersection over Union (IoU):** Measure of overlap between predicted and ground truth bounding boxes.
- **Average Precision (AP):** Precision averaged across different IoU thresholds.
- **Mean Average Precision (mAP):** Average of AP across multiple classes or images.

### Image Segmentation
In image segmentation, key metrics are:
- **Intersection over Union (IoU):** Measure of overlap between predicted and ground truth segmentation masks.
- **Dice Coefficient:** Similarity metric for comparing two samples.
- **Pixel Accuracy:** Percentage of correctly classified pixels.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized as follows:
- `/code`: Contains scripts and notebooks for metric calculation and evaluation.
- `/data`: Data samples or references for testing and demonstration purposes.
- `/docs`: Additional documentation or research papers related to the explored metrics.
- `/results`: Output and visualization of metrics applied to specific models or datasets.

## Getting Started

To explore and utilize the metrics:
1. Clone the repository: `git clone <repository_url>`
2. Navigate to specific task directories within `/code`.
3. Run the provided scripts or notebooks to compute and visualize metrics.
